Internet Enabled Home Automation System

This project aims to develop a completely open set of software and hardware for wireless home automation or "Internet of Things".

Main goals are:

Simple protocol
Low cost per node
Easy to get components
Powered Nodes can relay messages
Very Low power consumption
Two way communication
Must be able to connect to cloud services. (Thingspeak,twitter, myrobot, nimbits, etc )
It is not:

Is not compatible with ANT, Zigbee, BT or anything like that.
Range is not great, at 2.4Ghz and 2mbit indoor communication range is reduced.
In order to keep the cost per node as low as possible, we would be using Atmel AVR family of Î¼C and Nordic nRF24L01+.
